# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My application will be a source for HR professionals to quickly add, edit, and remove employees from a database. It will allow administrators to create an employee with all necessary employee information. Future administrators will be able to edit these fields, add fields, or remove fields from each employee as time goes on. Users will be able to sort by relevant data such as start date, birth date, job category, etc quickly and efficiently.  

### Features

1. User login: users will be able to log in to the application and update the employee directory.
2. Create an employee: users will be able to create a new employee and add all custom fields.
3. Edit an employee: users will be able to edit employees information.
4. Archive an employee: users will be able to archive an employee who is no longer with the company. 
5. Sorting: users will be able to sort the employee directory based on specific fields.

### Technologies

My plan will be to use the following technologies:

Java
MySQL
Thymeleaf
Spring Boot

### What I'll Have to Learn

I would like to create a way to export employee dates (birth date, start date, etc) to a calendar that would be accessible by any authenticated user. I would like to figure out a way to make this possible to create an "Employee Birthday Calendar" that could sync up with Google Calendar, iCal, Outlook, or any other online calendar. I would like to incorporate a public API in some sort, but I am not completely sure how/what I would like to do.
